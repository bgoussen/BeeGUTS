### Aim of the package
The goal of BeeGUTS is to analyse the survival toxicity tests performed for
bee species. It can be used to fit a Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic (TKTD) model
adapted for bee standard studies (acute oral, acute contact, and chronic oral studies).
The TKTD model used is the General Unified Threshold model of Survival (GUTS).

## Installation

You can install the released version of BeeGUTS from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("BeeGUTS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(BeeGUTS)
## basic example code
