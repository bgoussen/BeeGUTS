BeeGUTS project:

Scope: Implement support for multiple files for the calibration

General idea:

Make all the objects to contain lists for each of the various datasets
e.g. beeSurvData is a list and each element of the list contains a list 
with data from each dataset:
   if I have 3 files, beeSurvData$survData will be a list of length 3 with
   each element contiaining the table of the survival data.

This will require the plotting and fitting routine to accept the new data structure

Implementation for the plotting:
Ideas from the internet on how to display all the plots for multiple datasets

1) Having a dropdown menu to choose the dataset
see this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66141967/r-switching-between-graphs
Official tutorial from Plotly: https://plotly.com/r/dropdowns/
  * This might require to use directly plotly for all the plotting so that
    there are no conversion issues with ggplot2 (see point2)

2)Something else than plotly, apparently there are several issues when converting a
ggplot2 plot into plotly, especially in terms of having the right axis and the right
titles

3) Have some sort of app to display plots (Shiny?)

Implementation for the fitting:
Not to disrupt the current framework, the various datasets could be treated in the 
same way as the different treatement are handled. The different datasets could be
flattened onto the treatment variables.
NOTE: Need to check if the time information can be passed independently so that 
we avoid problem with different datasets having different time durations (or binning).
