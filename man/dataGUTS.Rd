\title{Read and format the data for the BeeGUTS model}
\usage{
dataGUTS(
  file_location = NULL,
  test_type = NULL,
  bee_species = "Honey_Bee",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_location}{Location of a text file containing two datasets, one for the survival data,
and one for the concentration data. Both datasets must be included in the same file and contain the same number of column in the same order.
The following columns must be included in the survival dataset:
\itemize{
\item \code{Survival time \[d\]}: a vector of time in days
\item \code{Control} A vector of number of survivors for the control
\item \code{T1} - \code{Tn} A vector of number of survivors for the treatments
T1 to Tn, one column per treatment.
}
A line containing the \code{Concentration unit} must be included directly after the end of
the last row of the survival data.

The following columns must be included in the concentration dataset
\itemize{
\item \code{Concentration time \[d\]}: a vector of time in days.
\item \code{Control} A vector of concentrations for the control
\item \code{T1} - \code{Tn} A vector of concentration for the treatments
T1 to Tn, one column per treatment.
}
For the \code{Acute_Oral} and \code{Acute_Contact}, only the initial
exposure concentration at time 0 is required.

See detail section for example}

\item{test_type}{the test type amongst "Acute_Oral", "Acute_Contact", and "Chronic_Oral"}

\item{bee_species}{the bee type. At the moment only "Honey_Bee" is supported}

\item{...}{Optional arguments to be passed to the concentration reconstruction (e.g.
\code{k_sr =} for the stomach release rate (d-1), default is 0.625,
\code{k_ca =} contact availability rate (d-1), default is 0.4), or
\code{cTime =} the duration of exposure in days for the acute oral tests, default is 0.25 d}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{beeSurvData}, which is a list with the following information:
\item{survData}{A table containing the survival data as entered by the user in the input file}
\item{survData_long}{A data frame containing the survival data in long format for model purposes}
\item{concData}{A table containing the concentration data as entered by the user in the input file}
\item{concData_long}{A data frame containing concentration data in long format}
\item{unitData}{A character vector containing the units of the data as entered in the line \code{Concentration unit}
of the input file}
\item{typeData}{A character vector containing the type of experiment}
\item{beeSpecies}{A character vector containing the type bee}
\item{concModel}{A data frame containing the concentration data as recalculated by the model}
\item{concModel_long}{A data frame containing the concentration data as recalculated by the model in a long format}
}
\description{
Read data from a \code{text} or \code{csv} file and recalculate the
exposure profile depending on the type of experiment (acute oral, acute contact, chronic oral).
