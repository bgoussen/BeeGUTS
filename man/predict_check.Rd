\value{
The function return a list with three items:
\item{PPC}{The criterion, in percent, compares the predicted median numbers
of survivors associated to their uncertainty limits with the observed numbers
of survivors. Based on experience, PPC resulting in less than \eqn{50\%} of the
observations within the uncertainty limits indicate poor model performance. A fit of
\eqn{100\%} may hide too large uncertainties of prediction (so covering all data).}
\item{PPC_global}{percentage of PPC for the whole data set by gathering replicates.}
\item{NRMSE}{The criterion, in percent, is based on the classical root-mean-square error (RMSE),
used to aggregate the magnitudes of the errors in predictions for various time-points
into a single measure of predictive power. In order to provide a criterion expressed
as a percentage, NRMSE is the normalised RMSE by the mean of the observations.}
\item{NRMSE_global}{NRMSE for the whole data set by gathering replicates.}
\item{SPPE}{The SPPE indicator, in percent, is negative (between \eqn{0} and \eqn{-100\%}) for an
underestimation of effects, and positive (between \eqn{0} and \eqn{100}) for an
overestimation of effects. An SPPE value of \eqn{0} means an exact prediction
of the observed survival probability at the end of the exposure profile.}

\description{
Function from the \code{morse v 3.3.1} package.
It returns measures of goodness-of-fit for predictions.

Function from the \code{morse v 3.3.1} package.
Provide various criteria for assessment of the model performance:
(i) percentage of observation within the 95\\% credible
interval of the Posterior Prediction Check (PPC), the Normalised Root Mean
Square Error (NRMSE) and the Survival Probability Prediction Error (SPPE) as
reccommended by the recent Scientific Opinion from EFSA (2018).
