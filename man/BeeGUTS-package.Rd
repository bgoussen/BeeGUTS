\title{'BeeGUTS' package; a package to perform GUTS modelling for Bee experiments.}
\description{
Provide tools to analyse the survival toxicity tests performed for
bee species. It can be used to fit a Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic (TKTD) model
adapted for bee standard studies (acute oral, acute contact, and chronic oral studies).
The TKTD model used is the General Unified Threshold model of Survival (GUTS).

The package follows the concept and assumptions presented in Baas et al (submitted)
