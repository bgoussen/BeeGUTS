## Documentation

The goal of BeeGUTS is to analyse the survival toxicity tests performed
for bee species. It can be used to fit a Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic
(TKTD) model adapted for bee standard studies (acute oral, acute
contact, and chronic oral studies). The TKTD model used is the General
Unified Threshold model of Survival (GUTS).
